# BombGameSE

## Purpose of the project

This project was part of the subject "Software Engineering" at the HTWG Konstanz. The exercise should teach the students
the benefits of agile softwaredevelopement and the usage of patterns. The goal of this project was to develope a simple
desktop game in a group of 2, while using the model-view-controller pattern, J-unit tests and as much design patterns as
possible (reasonable scope). We used a jenkins server for continuos integration, which built the projects with maven and
put the results on a sonar server to examine the changed features.
Overall the students should get in touch with agile developement tools and experience the agile methods on their own.

## Specifications

### Tools
* game written in Java
* use Eclipse as IDE
* use GIT/EGIT as sourcecode management system
* use a continoues integration tool (jenkins)
* use sonar as quality management platform
* use j-unit for testing

### Final Qualities
Game should...
* provide a model-view-controller structure
* have a code coverage of 100% (except GUI / TUI)
* be able to run GUI and TUI simultaneously
* provide 0% code duplication
* provide 0% tangle index
* use interfaces and components

## Developement

## Final Product

## How to install

## Open Issues
* the game does not catch highscores
* the game does not provide any soundeffects
* the AI is not that intelligent
* the movement of the objects could be smoother
